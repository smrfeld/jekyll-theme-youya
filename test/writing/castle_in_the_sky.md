## Here are some equation

The forward diffusion process is defined as:

$$q(x_t | x_0) = N(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha_t}} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha_t}) \cdot I)$$

The loss looks ends up looking like this:

$$L(\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^T L_t(\theta)$$

with nice inline math formatting for the probability $$q(x_t \mid x_0)$$ as well.
